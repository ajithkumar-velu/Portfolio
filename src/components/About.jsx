            <p>Hi, I'm Ajith Kumar V â€” a dedicated and enthusiastic full-stack developer with a strong passion for building web applications that solve real-world problems. My core expertise lies in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), and I enjoy working across both frontend and backend to create seamless user experiences.

I love writing clean, maintainable code and constantly seek opportunities to improve my skills through hands-on projects and coding challenges. Whether it's developing dynamic user interfaces or designing robust APIs, I take pride in delivering high-quality solutions that make a difference.

I'm also a continuous learner who keeps up with the latest trends in web development, and I'm always excited to collaborate, grow, and contribute to impactful tech-driven initiatives.
